# MAGD-150-Portfolio
For Lab 1 I had a lot of trouble programming it and it turned out sloppy.
For Lab 2 I made 3 triangles as mountains and three balloons made out of elipses and lines.
For Lab 3 I made it where if you move your mouse the background changes color and an elipse in the middle grows bigger. When the mouse stops, the color of the background is changed to a maroon color.
For Lab 4 I tried to make a pizza, but I failed and ended up with a pizza that, when you click in the screen, moves the pizza diagonal and if you click again it goes back to its original spot.
For Lab 5 I made a Minecraft themed program where there were two buttons Labeled Nether and OverWorld. If you click Nether, it will turn the background color red, if you click OverWorld, the background color turns blue.
